# Lab01
This set of lab tasks was designed to be an initial exposure to C#. The tasks are simple yet allowed me to get a feel for the language.

## Calculator
The `Calculator` application is a very simple GUI based calculator with three operations, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
## Calculator2
The `Calculator2` task was to build a text based calculator, where a user could input equations in plain text and see results. The numbers and the operators are separated by spaces. An example equation would be `10 + 16`, which would yield `26` in return.
## FizzBuzz
This is the classic fizzbuzz program which outputs all numbers from 1 to 100 to the console, replacing all numbers that are divisible by 3 with `Fizz`, ones that are divisible by 5 with `Buzz`, and ones that are divisible by both 3 and 5 with `FizzBuzz`.
## GUI
This task was my first exposure to .NET GUIs within C#, I have had previous experience with VB and VB.net so this task was relatively simple, it was to make a checkbox that changes the colour of the text to red in a textbox when checked, and back to black when unchecked.
## Numbers
A simple task to calculate different numerical options such as sums and powers of input numbers, which the result is then output to the console.
## SimpleApp1
This task was to build a GUI that changed the text of a label to `Hello ` plus whatever the user input in the textbox when the button is pressed.
